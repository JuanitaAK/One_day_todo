### About this project

During my studies as Ada Tech School in Paris, France I had to do a project with React as a framework.  To undersant it's function, the use of props, states, keys, etc. I decided to fallow this tutorial :

I used it to creat my own One day Todo. 

Beacuse its not relied to an API or to a data base the information you type will be available while you dont refresh your wabe page. 

I use this to have a daily todo and and do a small project while using the tutorial to helped me understand the main conceptes of React.
